This repository contains the source code and experimental framework for the paper:

**"Optimizing Deep Learning for Cotton Leaf Disease Detection Using Meta-Heuristic Feature Selection Algorithms"**  
*Naeem Ullah, Francisco Martínez-Álvarez, Ivanoe De Falco, Giovanna Sannino*  

## Project Overview

This project presents DeepCCNetFS, a novel deep learning-based model for detecting cotton leaf diseases. To enhance its classification performance and computational efficiency, we integrate several meta-heuristic feature selection algorithms:

- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Rain Water Algorithm (RWA)
- Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA)
- Bee Evolutionary Algorithm (Bees-CNN)

The dataset used is the publicly available Kaggle cotton leaf disease dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seroshkarim/cotton-leaf-disease-dataset), consisting of 1,711 labeled images across four classes.



## Setup & Requirements

This project uses MATLAB R2022 or later. Ensure the Image Processing and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolboxes are available.
